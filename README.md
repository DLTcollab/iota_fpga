Proof-of-Concept (PoC) created for DE10-nano board based on Cyclone V 5CSEBA6U23I7 FPGA device

PoC parameters:
- Hardware recources: 11% of 5CSEBA6U23I7 FPGA 
- Operation frequency: 100 MHz
- Hashrate: 1 204 819 hash/sec 
- POW accelaretion: x90 - x500 (software POW calc: 10-50 min, hardware accelerated POW calc: 2-20 sec)
